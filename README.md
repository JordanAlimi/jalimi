_bird_watch [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mkrogemann/bird_watch.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mkrogemann/bird_watch)
===========

The code in this repo has been developed for a [blog post](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2016/01/elixir-phoenix-couchdb-introduction/).

Before you try to start the app, please install and start CouchDB.

Then, to start your Phoenix app:

  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  2. In case you want to seed the database, run `mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs`
     The seeding will run against the dev schema unless you specify another environment like so:
     `MIX_ENV=prod mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs`
     In you want to execute the tests on your machine, please seed a test database:
     `MIX_ENV=test mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs`
  3. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
